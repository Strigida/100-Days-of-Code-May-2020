## Day 1: Javascript Essentials
*5/1/2020*

---
Started my 100 Days of Code by going through new modules in freeCodeCamp.org ’s JavaScript portion, as there’s a few new lessons on the site since I finished up the basics portion, there.

---
## Day 2: JavaScript, Continued
*5/2/2020*

---
Today I brushed up on JavaScript `import` and `export` functions, as well as module script creation and promises. Thank you, freeCodeCamp.org !

**Note:**
Practice promises.

---
## Days 3 - 5: JavaScript, Continued
*5/3/2020 - 5/5/2020*

---
Worked from freeCodeCamp.org, still going through the new material added since my previous run-though of the course, including starting learning regular expressions (regex).

---
## Day 6: JavaScript Regular Expressions
*05/06/2020*

---
Worked entirely on freeCodeCamp.org finishing up regexs (JavaScript).

---
## Day 7: New Project Started
*5/7/2020*

---
An idea based on thoughts I've had since the pandemic lockdown suddenly took form, so I started a new project in HTML5 and JavaScript as a prototype. Eventually this will need to be multi-platform (mobile, web, VR/AR/MR), and I may move the demo to Unity once I've worked through the prototype a bit.

---
## Day 8: More JavaScript
*5/8/2020*

---
Today's hour of code was spent in freeCodeCamp.org on debugging and arrays!
I realized I still need to brush up on some JavaScript functionality to get what I want out of my prototype, so back to the grind!

---
## Day 9: My First Markdown
*5/11/2020*

---
Today is all about learning markdown, and this is my first markdown document.

I primarily spent today's hour of code reading up on the subject courtesy of links recommended by the talented [Caleb Wells](https://calebwells.dev), creator of [A Swiftly Tilting Planet](https://github.com/calebrwells/A-Swiftly-Tilting-Planet), and creating a markdown sheet to guide my documentation for further projects.

I also spent time on freeCodeCamp.org, brushing up on JavaScript array functionalities, such as `.splice`, and `.slice`.

---
## Day 10: Updates and Arrays
*5/12/2020*

---
Since all my previous README's and updates were a) scattered over multiple documents, and b) in multiple files (including .txt files) I spent the first half of today's time updating this document with the information from previous days. I'm much happier with how my files look, now.

With my remaining few minutes I got onto freeCodeCamp.org to delve into arrays again, and learned about the spread operator (`[...arr]`), in conjunciton with the `.push()` function.

**Note:**
Practice `while() {}` loops.

---
## Day 11: Modifying Arrays, and Interview Prep
*5/13/2020*

---
Spent the first part of my hour researching web dev interview questions, and then brainstorming programatic answers. Afterward, I went back to freeCodeCamp.org to finish out the hour playing with spread operators (`[...array]`) and `.indexOf()`!

---
## Day 12: Objects
*5/14/2020*

---
Worked with key - value pairs (`name: 'Hermione Granger'`) in objects, including iterating through keys in an object, or checking if an object has a property.

---
## Day 13: Web Dev Interview
*5/15/2020*

![Overhead Image of Interview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Strigida/100-Days-of-Code-May-2020/master/undraw_interview_rmcf.png "Interview")
---
Today I had a phone interview for a web developer position, which went fairly well. The job was slightly out of my comfort level, so I thought it would be a good learning experience. All-in-all I enjoyed it, and got some good adviece from the interviewer: 
Work on lots of little projects of different types, to get a feel for what you like!
It's advice I plan to take!

**Note:**
The above illustration was obviously pre-pandemic, so forgive the subjects for not wearing PPE or respecting the 6' rule. lol

---
## Day 14: Basic JavaScript Algorithms
*5/17/2020*

---
Today's hour of code was spent on learning some basic algorithms; something my fomal degree didn't spend much time on. So far, I'm enjoying the challenge greatly, and can see it will make me a much more effective programmer!

---
## Day 15: Technical UX Interview
*5/18/2020*

---
![Data Structures](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Strigida/100-Days-of-Code-May-2020/master/undraw_software_engineer_lvl5.png "Software Engineer Designing Data Structure")

---
I spent a bit over 2 hours working on a design challenge as part of an interview for a Technical UX Design postion contracted to a game company. The job is all about HUDs, menus, and interfaces, and was a lot of fun to work on! 
I got to create a data structure, as well as a function that delivers weapons combos based on their combined damage ratings. 

I won't know how I did for a while, but it was a great experience, and my 100 Days of Code definitely gave me an edge I didn't have, before! Onward!

---
## Day 16: Algorithm Practice
*5/19/2020*

---
I'm back to my algorithm practice, today, and was presented some fun problems to solve by freeCodeCamp.org! Among other things, I got to put `string.length` to practice, as well as a type of for loop that itterates though arrays (`for (word in array) {}`)!

I'm quite glad to have started this hundred days of code, as I feel like I'm progressing faster than I have before! It feels good to get back into the code, after a year+ hiatus!
