## Day 9: My First Markdown
---
Today is all about learning markdown, and this is my first markdown document.

I primarily spent today's hour of code reading up on the subject courtesy of links recommended by the talented [Caleb Wells](https://calebwells.dev), creator of [A Swiftly Tilting Planet](https://github.com/calebrwells/A-Swiftly-Tilting-Planet), and creating a markdown sheet to guide my documentation for further projects.

I also spent time on freeCodeCamp.org, brushing up on JavaScript array functionalities, such as `.splice`, and `.slice`.
